Ideas for cleaning:

If no home or home city replace home and home city with None.

*Don't read in the columns RefID, BaseID, Source, Factions, Class Details, Location, Level, Health, Magicka, Stamina, Sells, Buys, Perks, Horses and Race Details*

Split primary skills to be only their first primary skill. Make this first primary skill have a column called First Skill. 

Change morality to statistical values instead of categorical values



People of Skyrim
A dataset that contains information about Skyrim named NPCs

About Dataset
Context

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the most amazing RPG that I have ever played. One of the most interesting things about Skyrim for me is the diverse cast of NPCs that you can interact with. Each NPC has their own background and personality which makes it really fun to interact with them. This is why I think it would be interesting if we can make analysis from NPC in Skyrim.
The script to scrape the data is available at: https://github.com/muhajipra/scrapeskyrimwiki
Content

This dataset is acquired by using Beautiful Soup 4 to scrape the data from infobox of each character listed in https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:People
After cleaning the data a little bit, the total number of named characters are 1009, I only include named characters from the link above so characters such as hostile NPC are not included in this dataset.
Acknowledgements

This dataset uses information from Unofficial Elder Scrolls Page which contains a lot of amazing information, I would like to thank the fans for contributing to the page.
The creation of this dataset is also inspired from Skyrim Census made by Ant Pulley using Tableau which you can view by clicking this link. It inspires me to gather my own dataset.
Inspiration

I hope this dataset can help you to gain more insight about the world of Skyrim.
