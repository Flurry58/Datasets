# About Dataset

**Contents**

This dataset contains detailed specifications, release dates, and release prices of computer parts.

The dataset contains two CSV files: gpus.csv for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and cpus.csv for Central Processing Units (CPUs). Each table has its own list of unique entries, but the list of features includes: clock speeds, maximum temperatures, display resolutions, power draws, number of threads, release dates, release prices, die size, virtualization support, and many other similar fields. For more specific column-level metadata refer to the Column Metadata.

**Inspiration**

- How did performance over price ratio evolve over time?
- How about general computing power?
- Are there any manufacturers that are known for some specific range of performance & price?
